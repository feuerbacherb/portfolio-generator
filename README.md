# Portfolio Generator

## Description
Portfolio Generator was developed in order to allow users to easily create a portfolio of their development history through a command-line interface.  With easy to answer questions, anyone who has created pages on the internet can simply go through the questions and have a nice, organized web page that not only can list their projects, but also allows the user to feature projects they are extremely proud of.

## Installation
Installation of Portfolio Generator is fairly straightforward.
- Clone the Portfolio Generator project from GitHub
- Open Git Bash in the directory where you would like the project to be depoloyed and type in:
```npm install```
The installation is fairly straightforward.
One change that might need to be made is in the package.json file.  Open it and check to make sure the "type" is "commonjs".
